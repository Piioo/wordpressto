= Wordpressto

Wordpressto is a Ruby library for reading from and writing to
{Wordpress}[http://www.wordpress.org] blogs via their XMLRPC
interface.

It was extracted from another project and isn't yet feature complete,
but it is still useful. The documentation is lacking and the test
suite is not complete. Remember though: release early and release
often!

== Installation

  sudo gem install wordpressto

== Documentation

  require 'wordpressto'
  blog = Wordpressto::WordpressBlog.new :url => 'http://www.example.com/xmlrpc.php',
